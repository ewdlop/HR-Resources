The line you shared is a famous poetic quote that speaks to the tragic fate of beautiful women in traditional Chinese literature. Let me provide a deep analysis:

Original Line: 自古紅顏多薄命不許人間見白頭

Breaking down the poetry:
- 自古 (zì gǔ): Since ancient times
- 紅顏 (hóng yán): Beautiful woman (literally "red face/complexion")
- 多薄命 (duō báo mìng): Often have a thin/fragile fate
- 不許 (bù xǔ): Not allowed
- 人間 (rén jiān): In the human world
- 見白頭 (jiàn bái tóu): See white/gray hair (symbolizing longevity)

Poetic Meaning:
The line suggests that beautiful women throughout history are often destined for tragedy, rarely permitted to enjoy a long life and reach old age. It reflects a deeply melancholic view of female existence in traditional Chinese culture, where beauty was often seen as both a blessing and a curse.

Context:
This sentiment is prevalent in classical Chinese poetry, particularly works that lament the short lives of beautiful women. It reflects historical social conditions where women were viewed as ephemeral beings - valued for their youth and beauty but not expected to live long, full lives.

Literary Significance:
- Reflects traditional Chinese aesthetic and social perspectives
- Captures the melancholy of female existence in historical context
- Demonstrates the poetic tradition of using physical beauty as a metaphor for life's transience
